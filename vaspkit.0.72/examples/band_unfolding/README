Step 1: Prepare POSCAR file including supercell model. The supercell should be constracted on the basis of the primitive cell (not conventional cell);

Step 2: Prepare VPKIT.in file including the multiplicity of the primitive cell that was used to build a supercell;

Step 3: Prepare KPATH.in file with Line-mode for primitive cell band structure calculation;  

Step 4: Run vaspkit with task 281 and set KPT resolution value less than 0.03;

Step 5: Run vasp_std with setting "LWAVE = T" in INCAR file; It is advised to increase the number of empty bands (NBANDS=... in INCAR file) by a factor of 1.2-2 beyond a VASP-proposed defaul value to get a resonable description of higher energy states.  

Step 6: Re-run vaspkit with task 282 to get the EBS.dat file inlcuding effective band structure data;

Setp 7: run "python ebs_plot.py" in terminal window and you will get the EBS.pdf file.


* Of course you can use the same procedure to calculate effective band strucutre at hybrid-DFT or Meta-GGA level
* Keep in mind that the fractional coordinates of all hight-symmetry-points must be within the [-0.5, 0.5] range.
